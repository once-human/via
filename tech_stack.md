# Tech Stack for VIA - Subscription-Based Ride Service

## Overview
This document outlines the technological choices for building the VIA app, a subscription-based ride service focusing on reliability and predictability for both riders and drivers. The tech stack is optimized for cross-platform development with premium UI/UX, while keeping costs minimal for this MVP phase.

## Frontend Development

### Core Framework
- **Flutter (v3.19+)**: Cross-platform framework for building natively compiled applications from a single codebase
  - Provides excellent performance on both iOS and Android
  - Supports rich, customizable UI components
  - Enables smooth animations and transitions seen in the design mockups

### UI/UX Implementation
- **Material Components & Cupertino**: For platform-adaptive design elements
- **Flutter Hooks**: For improved state management within functional components
- **Google Maps Flutter**: For map integration and location services
- **Lottie**: For high-quality animations as seen in onboarding and loading screens
- **Flutter SVG**: For rendering SVG assets with perfect scaling

### State Management
- **Riverpod**: Provides simple but powerful state management
  - Preferred over Provider for better testing and code organization
  - Supports dependency injection for clean architecture

### Notifications & Real-time Features
- **Flutter Local Notifications**: For in-app and scheduled notifications
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging**: For push notifications about ride updates

### Haptics & User Experience
- **Haptic Feedback**: Using flutter_haptic for premium touch responses
- **Smooth Page Indicator**: For polished onboarding experience
- **Shimmer Effects**: For loading states that match the app's premium feel

## Backend Services

### Authentication & Database
- **Firebase Authentication**: For secure user sign-up and login
  - Email/password authentication
  - Social login integration (Google, Apple)
- **Firebase Firestore**: NoSQL database for:
  - User profiles
  - Subscription plans
  - Ride history
  - Driver information
- **Firebase Storage**: For profile pictures and other media storage

### Location & Mapping Services
- **Firebase GeoFirestore**: For geospatial queries and driver-rider matching
- **Google Maps Platform**: For geocoding, routing, and distance calculation
  - Direction API for calculating routes
  - Distance Matrix API for estimating ride times

### Payments
- **Stripe SDK**: For handling subscription payments and managing billing cycles
  - Seamless integration with Flutter
  - Support for multiple payment methods

### Cloud Functions
- **Firebase Cloud Functions**: For backend business logic
  - Matching algorithm between riders and drivers
  - Subscription management
  - Notification triggers
  - Payment processing

## DevOps & Deployment

### Version Control
- **Git/GitHub**: For code management and collaboration

### CI/CD
- **GitHub Actions**: For automated testing and deployment
  - Automated testing on PR
  - Automated deployment to testing environments

### Hosting & Deployment
- **Firebase Hosting**: For hosting the web version and marketing site
- **GitHub Pages**: Alternative for static marketing website
- **Google Play Store & Apple App Store**: For mobile app distribution

### Analytics & Monitoring
- **Firebase Analytics**: For user behavior tracking
- **Firebase Crashlytics**: For crash reporting and stability monitoring
- **Firebase Performance Monitoring**: For app performance tracking

## Third-Party Services

### Maps & Location
- **Google Maps API**: For mapping, routing, and location services
  - Free tier includes substantial usage before costs incur

### SMS & Communication
- **Twilio Verify**: For phone number verification (can start with Firebase Auth's phone verification which offers free quota)

### Testing
- **Flutter Test**: For unit and widget testing
- **Integration Testing**: Using Flutter Driver
- **Firebase Test Lab**: For testing on real device fleets (free tier available)

## Architecture & Design Patterns

### Project Structure
- **Feature-first Architecture**: Organizing code by features rather than technical concerns
- **Clean Architecture**: Separating business logic from UI and external services

### Design Patterns
- **BLoC Pattern**: For separating business logic
- **Repository Pattern**: For data access abstraction
- **Dependency Injection**: For better testability and modularity

## Specific UI/UX Components Based on References
- **Custom Bottom Navigation**: As seen in the HOME FINALLLL.png
- **Animated Map Integration**: For ride tracking screens (ongoing ride.png)
- **Custom Ride Cards**: For displaying scheduled rides
- **Custom Calendar Interface**: For scheduling recurring rides
- **Ride Status Timeline**: For tracking ride progress
- **Driver Profile Cards**: With rating and information display
- **Custom Dialog Boxes**: For confirmations and alerts

## Cost Considerations
All selected technologies offer generous free tiers suitable for MVP development:
- Firebase offers substantial free quotas for Authentication, Firestore, Storage, and Functions
- Google Maps API provides a $200 monthly credit for API calls
- GitHub/Vercel offer free hosting for projects
- Flutter is completely free and open source

This tech stack prioritizes development speed, cross-platform compatibility, and premium user experience while minimizing costs during the MVP phase.
